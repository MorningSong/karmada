## What's New

### Precise Quota Support for Multi-Component Workloads

Previously, Karmada uses the `GetReplicas` interface to obtain workload replica and resource requests for calculating total resource requirements. However, many CRDs (such as FlinkDeployments) consist of multiple podTemplates or components, each with different resource requirements. The current interface cannot express these differences, leading to inaccurate resource calculations.

This release adds support for precise resource calculation of multi-component workloads through the new `GetComponents` interface. Karmada can now retrieve replica and resource requests for each component within a workload, enabling accurate resource accounting for Multi-Component Workloads.

This can be especially useful if:
- You need to track resource consumption and limits of Multi-Component Workloads.
- You would like to prevent unnecessary scheduling of Multi-Component Workloads by verifying quota resource limits.

As Multi-Component Workloads become more common in cloud-native ecosystems, Karmada recognizes the need for enhanced support for these workloads. Precise quota management is just one aspect of this effort. In the next release, we will further improve scheduling support for multi-component workloads â€” stay tuned!

For a detailed description of this feature, see the [Proposal: Multiple Pod Templates Support](https://github.com/karmada-io/karmada/tree/master/docs/proposals/scheduling/multi-podtemplate-support)

(Feature contributors: @mszacillo, @seanlaii, @RainbowMango, @zclyne, @Dyex719, @zhzhuang-zju, @liaolecheng)

### Support Stateful Application Cluster Failover

Karmada currently supports propagating various types of resources, including Kubernetes objects and CRDs. This also includes stateful workloads, enabling multi-cluster resilience and elastic scaling for distributed applications. The advantage of stateless workloads is their higher fault tolerance, as the loss of workloads does not impact application correctness or require data recovery. In contrast, stateful workloads (like Flink) depend on checkpointed or saved state to recover after failures. If that state is lost, the job may not be able to resume from where it left off.

For workloads, failover scenarios include two cases: the first is when the workload itself fails and needs to be migrated to another cluster; the second is when the cluster encounters a failure, such as node crashes, network partitions, or control plane outages, requiring some workloads within the cluster to be migrated.

The Karmada community has completed the design and development for the first scenario in version v1.12. In version v1.15, we will support the second scenario: cluster failover for stateful applications. We will ensure that when the migration mode is `Directly`, the Karmada system will first remove the application from the original cluster, and only after the application is completely removed can it be scheduled to the new cluster.

(Feature contributors: @XiShanYongYe-Chang, @liaolecheng)

### Remarkable Performance Optimization of the Karmada Controllers and Schedulers

In this release, the performance optimization team continues to enhance Karmada's performance with significant improvements in the controllers and the scheduler.

#### karmada controllers

For controllers, the implementation of the [controller-runtime priority queue](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/controller-runtime/issues/2374) allows controllers built on controller-runtime to prioritize the most recent changes after a restart or leader transition. This approach defers the processing of create events and prioritizes user-triggered resources, which can significantly reduce downtime during service restarts and failovers.

The test setup includes 5,000 Deployments, 2,500 Policies, and 5,000 Bindings, with the `ControllerPriorityQueue` feature gate enabled in the karmada-controller-manager. Immediately following the restart of the karmada-controller-manager, a Deployment and a Policy are updated while the work queue still contains a substantial number of pending events. The update events for both the Deployment and Policy are promptly responded to and processed by the controllers.

#### karmada scheduler

For the scheduler, optimizations are made to reduce redundant calculations during scheduling and decrease the frequency of remote calls to karmada-scheduler-estimator. These changes greatly improve the scheduler's QPS (Queries Per Second).

The test measures QPS by recording the time taken to schedule 5,000 ResourceBinding objects. The results are as follows:

- scheduling QPS increased from ~15 to ~22, a 46% improvement.
- scheduling gRPC requests to karmada-scheduler-estimator reduced from ~10000 to ~5000, a 50% reduction.

These test results prove that the performance of karmada controllers and karmada scheduler has been greatly enhanced in v1.15. In the future, we will continue to carry out systematic performance optimizations on the controllers and the scheduler.

For the detailed progress and test report, please refer to [Issue: [Performance] Overview of performance improvements for v1.15](https://github.com/karmada-io/karmada/issues/6516).
